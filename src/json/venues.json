    "note": "Carlon is hard to find using Google Maps. You will want to park and walk there. From Adelbert Gym you will want to make a right and head up Adelbert Road and over the bridge. Once you are over the bridge, you will see a parking lot on your right, and a cross walk at the light. Cross the cross walk and follow the path leading up around the building that will be on your right. You will see stairs once you come around the building. Head up those stairs, and Carlton Commons will be on the right."
