    "bio": "Valerie Salstrom is one of America's busiest and most enthusiastic swing dance instructors. Valerie has been dancing Lindy Hop, Balboa, Charleston and multiple forms of Shag since the early 1990s and has been a consistent favorite on the international teaching circuit for nearly twenty years. She co-founded the Cleveland based swing dance company Get Hep Swing in 1998. Along with a true joy for teaching, dancing and competing, Valerie also savors the opportunity to judge dance competitions and is frequently a main judge at national and international swing dance events.  Having had the opportunity to work with many of the original swing dance masters and innovators from Harlem, New York and Los Angeles, California, Valerie is adamant about paying forward her knowledge and love of the dance to the next generations. She has been a teaching artist for the Ohio Arts Council for close to 20 years and has done numerous in-school and after-school swing dance residencies with them. In 2007 Valerie founded the Cleveland Junior Jitterbugs after-school swing dance program which not only teaches youth in the Cleveland area about swing dancing but also helps them develop their skills in leadership, teamwork, communications and more. Although Valerie has won numerous dance competitions, her proudest achievement to date happened at the 2014 International Lindy Hop Championships when two of the members of The Cleveland Junior Jitterbugs, won the title of Junior World Lindy Hop Champions. She is hopeful that her work with the Cleveland Junior Jitterbugs will inspire more people to become involved in teaching swing dancing to young people.

    "bio": "Jacob started swing dancing in 2003 and has been hooked ever since. He is famous for his fast Pure Balboa footwork and his large repertoire of unique spins and turns when heâ€™s in the spotlight.  In his Lindy Hop he enjoys using a mix of classic style and new innovations seamlessly blended together.  As a teacher he enjoys using a mix of humorous (in his opinion) analogies and serious instruction to create a fun and exciting learning environment.",
